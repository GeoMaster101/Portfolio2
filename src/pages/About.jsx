                    My name is Giovanni and I currently am studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley.
                    I am passionate about using my skills and knowledge to create meaningful applications. I am also interested in
                    machine learning and learning other technologies to improve my skills. I am excited to learn more about these topics and apply them
                    to real-world problems.
